# Title: What an Expensive Time to be Alive!
# Description: Why is it so expensive to be alive today? We are going to use data to show something that is very close to us.
Which factors are attributed to the increased cost of living in Florida? 
Population? Rental prices? The barrier of entry to purchase a home? Overall state of the economy? What other factors are contributing to the rising cost of living in Florida?  
Assumption - The population growth in Florida (due to many factors over the past few years) has made the supply of places to live/rent not be able to keep up with the demand. 


We are going to look at the cost of living, rent, homeownership and other things related to being alive in 2023.
